        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a 3rd year B.Tech student,  at VIT Bhopal. With a keen interest in Web Development and Logical Programming, I've been actively involved in projects and internships that have honed my skills. My journey in tech began with coding, and I've since expanded my expertise to include data analysis, web development, and more.

            I am a tech team member at Blockchain Club VIT Bhopal, and I have completed a Business Analytics Virtual Internship Program powered by Qlik through SmartInternz. I am also involved in various projects that address societal needs, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.</p>
